# Netflix Data Analysis Project: Unveiling Streaming Insights

## Overview

This project analyzed a Netflix dataset to find key trends in content, audience preferences, and growth opportunities. We used visualizations to understand Netflix's content library.

## Project Goals

* Analyze Netflix content growth and makeup.
* See where content comes from geographically.
* Understand how content ratings are spread.
* Find popular genres and their ratings.
* Look at contributions of key directors and actors.
* Analyze how long movies and shows are.
* See if release year and duration are related.
* Suggest ways for Netflix to grow based on data.

## Dataset

The data had info on Netflix titles, like:

* Title
* Type (Movie, TV Show)
* Release Year
* Country
* Rating
* Genre
* Director
* Cast
* Duration (minutes or seasons)

## Analysis and Visualizations

We used Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for charts like:

* Content growth over time (line plots).
* Content origin by country (bar plots).
* Rating breakdown (bar and stacked bar charts).
* Top genres (bar plots).
* Top directors and actors (horizontal bar plots).
* Movie vs. show duration (box plots).
* Release year vs. duration (scatter plots, heatmaps).
* Ratings within genres (grouped bar charts).
* Movie/show count by director (grouped bar charts).

## Key Findings

* Netflix library has grown a lot, mostly movies.
* USA, India, UK are top content sources; need to clarify 'Unknown'.
* Many titles are mature-rated; more family content could help.
* Drama and international movies are popular.
* Key directors and actors have many titles, but director data has gaps.
* Movies are longer than TV shows.
* Weak link between release year and duration.
* Rating types differ between movies and shows, and across genres.

## Recommendations

Netflix should:

* **Balance** movies and shows more.
* **Add more** family-friendly content.
* **Invest more** in diverse global content.
* Use data to guide genre choices (popular and new).
* **Improve data** on content origin and directors.
* **Make better** recommendations using all data.
* Keep a mix of **new and old** content.
